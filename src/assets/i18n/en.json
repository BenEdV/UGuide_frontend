    "user_agreement": "<p>Dear student,</p><p>You’re about to use the THERMOS-tool. This tool is still under development so any help and feedback is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Please note that you should by no means feel pressured into using this tool. If so, do not continue and close this window. Furthermore, if you proceed to use the Thermos-dashboard, you confirm to have read and understand this statement, and agree to your (pseudonymized) data being stored and used to further develop this tool, the implementation in educational context, and/or for research purposes. If you do not agree, do not continue and close this window.</p><p>This text will briefly explain what data will be processed and stored, who will have access to it, and how this data helps the development of this tool.</p><h5>What data is collected, why, and with what purpose?</h5><p>With this tool we want to offer you support in studying at Utrecht University, by providing insight in your study behavior and helping you develop this. Your data is collected and processed for this purpose by Utrecht University and the principle behind the use of this information is the justified interest of Utrecht University.</p><p>We have composed a survey with questions about Motivation and Engagement, and Groupwork skills. Some questions are quite similar, which is not a trick but the way these surveys work. The survey used in this dashboard only measures aspects of your study behavior, not (e.g.) indications of your mental health.</p><p>After you’ve completed this survey, the data will be presented to you in a visualization. You can click on the topics you’re interested in to get feedback on how to work on these topics. After you’ve finished the survey and examined the tips and feedback, you can give us your opinion and feedback about this version of the tool. To do so, go to the ‘provide feedback’ section. We are curious to know how you’ve experienced the tool’s current look, the usefulness of the feedback and tips, and whatever comes to mind when you’re using the tool.</p><p>Apart from the personal data you provide in the surveys, the dashboard shows some personal (study progress) data from Osiris, specifically current study program, EC's obtained and average grade obtained in current study program. In order to show you this data in the dashboard, a SAML-token is used. By using this token, your SOLIS ID and the associated personal data cannot be traced within the Thermos dashboard. Lastly, while using the dashboard, your online behavior will be logged. </p><h5>Where is the data stored and for how long?</h5><p>The survey, feedback, and logdata are stored on a secured UU-server. To ensure protection of the data a penetration test was performed in 2019 by a third party, revealing minor issues that have been resolved. Only project members have access to the data. The data remains available until you are no longer a student at UU. After that, the data is pseudonymized and remains available for research purposes (for 10 years, <a href='www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Code_wetenschapsbeoefening_2004_(2014).pdf' _target='_blank'>recommended by the VSNU</a>), in accordance with UU’s <a href='https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/privacy-statement-utrecht-university' target='_blank'>privacy statement</a> (last modified on 17th of May 2018). UU has the right to update this statement when necessary.  The data is processed based on UU’s legitimate interest to improve provided education. Data will not be shared with third parties or with countries outside of the European Economic Area.</p><h5>Who has access to the data?</h5><p>Your teachers or tutors will not be able to view your data. You can, of course, show them your results if you want their help, but only if you want to. The stored data will only be accessible to THERMOS-project members and will be used to further develop the tool or for research purposes. Before your data is used for development and/or research purposes it will be pseudonymized. When pseudonymized, aggregated data can be used to give study programs an overarching view of the measured constructs for that specific study program.</p><h5>What rights do I have?</h5><p>You have several rights as a Thermos dashboard user; the right to inspect your data, to rectify data, to remove data, to limit data collection, to object data collection, and data portability. To exercise any of these rights, get in touch with <a href='mailto:l.b.devreugd-2@umcutrecht.nl'>l.b.devreugd-2@umcutrecht.nl</a>, or with <a href='mailto:privacy@uu.nl'>privacy@uu.nl</a> to do so anonymously.</p><h5>With whom can you get in touch for questions or complaints?</h5><p>For questions or complaints about the project, feel free to send an email to <a href='mailto:l.b.devreugd-2@umcutrecht.nl'>l.b.devreugd-2@umcutrecht.nl</a>. If you want to get in touch with the UU privacy officer, send an email to <a href='mailto:privacy@uu.nl'>privacy@uu.nl</a>.If you want to file an official complaint with the ‘Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens’, see <a href='https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/contact/contactgids/autoriteit-persoonsgegevens' target='_blank'>www.rijksoverheid.nl/contact/contactgids/autoriteit-persoonsgegevens</a>.
